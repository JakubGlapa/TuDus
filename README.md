# TuDus

Creating keyboard-first ToDo windows program with notion-like syntax. <br /><br />
`[ ]` Put square brackets at the beginning of the string. <br />
`[ ]` Creating new TuDus is just that easy. <br />
`[x]` To mark it done you either check the checkbox, or edit the text in the text field. <br />
`[x]` On `@08.07.2025` the app has been added to public repo for everyone to experience the TuDus! <br />
`[x]` You can also add `#Tags` to categorize TuDus! <br />
`[x]` When the text field is out of focus you won't see any of the TuDu tags (e.g. [x]/[ ], @, #). <br />
`[x]` Those are parsed to designated elemnts. <br />
`[ ]` Try for yourself. <br />
